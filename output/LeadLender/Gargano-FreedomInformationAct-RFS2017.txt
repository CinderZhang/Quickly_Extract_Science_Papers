A: Title: The Freedom of Information Act and the Race Toward Information Acquisition 

Authors: Antonio Gargano, Alberto G. Rossi and Russ Wermers



Q: Can you give me a very clear explanation of the core assertions, implications, and mechanics elucidated in this paper?

A: This paper investigates the use of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by institutional investors, particularly hedge funds, to gain access to non-public information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The authors argue that this information, which often requires specialized knowledge to interpret, can provide these investors with a competitive edge in the market.

The core assertions of the paper are:

1. Institutional investors, especially hedge funds, actively use FOIA to obtain potentially valuable information from the FDA. This information is not fully private, as it can be accessed by anyone who requests it, but it is not publicly disseminated either.

2. The information obtained through FOIA requests is often highly technical and requires specific scientific competence to interpret. This makes it a valuable resource for large, sophisticated institutional investors who have the resources to hire the necessary expertise.

3. The use of FOIA requests by institutional investors has grown significantly in recent years, mirroring the growth in other methods of information gathering.

4. Institutional investors often trade based on the information obtained through FOIA requests. The authors found that when institutional holdings increase in conjunction with a FOIA request, the following quarter's abnormal returns on the associated stocks average 6.58%. Conversely, when institutional holdings decrease, the following quarter's abnormal returns average -3.52%.

The implications of these findings are significant. They suggest that institutional investors are able to generate abnormal returns by exploiting a little-known source of information. This raises questions about the fairness and efficiency of the market, as these investors have an advantage over others who do not have access to or cannot interpret this information.

The mechanics of how this works are also explained in the paper. Institutional investors submit FOIA requests to the FDA related to specific pharmaceutical firms. They then analyze the information obtained and adjust their holdings of these companies accordingly. The authors use a combination of nonparametric tests and parametric panel regressions to analyze the trades of these investors and the returns they generate.



Q: Can you explain the value of this in basic terms? Like you're talking to a CEO. So what? What's the bottom line here?

A: Certainly. The bottom line of this research is that large institutional investors, such as hedge funds, are using the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to non-public information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This information often requires specialized knowledge to interpret, but it can provide these investors with a competitive edge in the market.

The research found that these investors often make trades based on this information, and these trades can generate significant returns. For example, when these investors increased their holdings in a company after making a FOIA request, they saw an average return of 6.58% in the following quarter.

This has important implications for market fairness and efficiency. It suggests that these institutional investors have an advantage over others who do not have access to or cannot interpret this information. As a CEO, this research might prompt you to consider how your company's information is being used by these investors and whether there are any steps you can take to ensure a level playing field.
