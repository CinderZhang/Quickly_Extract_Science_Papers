A: Title: Active Technological Similarity and Mutual Fund Performance

Authors: Ping McLemore, Richard Sias, Chi Wan, H. Zafer YÃ¼ksel



Q: Can you give me a very clear explanation of the core assertions, implications, and mechanics elucidated in this paper?

A: This paper investigates whether a mutual fund manager's superior understanding of technological innovation can lead to better fund performance. The authors propose a measure called Active Technological Similarity (ATS), which quantifies the extent to which a fund's portfolio is exposed to similar technological innovations. 

The core assertions of the paper are:

1. Mutual funds that increase their ATS (i.e., increase their exposure to similar technological innovations) tend to outperform those that decrease or maintain their ATS. This suggests that fund managers who understand and strategically invest in technological innovation can achieve higher returns.

2. The effect of ATS on fund performance is largely independent of other known predictors of mutual fund success, such as industry concentration, active share, fund R2, and lag fund alpha. This means that ATS can be used in combination with these other measures to better identify high-performing funds.

3. The positive relationship between ATS and fund performance primarily arises from trades that increase a fund's ATS. This implies that fund managers' ability to earn positive abnormal returns is largely driven by their purchases of stocks that increase the technological similarity of their portfolio.

The implications of these findings are significant for both fund managers and investors. For fund managers, the results suggest that understanding and strategically investing in technological innovation can be a source of competitive advantage. For investors, ATS and changes in ATS can be used as additional metrics to evaluate and select mutual funds.

The mechanics of ATS are based on the distribution of a firm's patents across different technology classes. The authors calculate the technological similarity between each stock in a fund's portfolio and the rest of the portfolio, and then compute the fund's overall ATS as the weighted average of these individual similarities. Changes in ATS are calculated as the difference between a fund's actual ATS and what its ATS would have been if the fund manager had not traded any stocks during the quarter.



Q: Can you explain the value of this in basic terms? Like you're talking to a CEO. So what? What's the bottom line here?

A: Absolutely. The bottom line of this research is that mutual fund managers who understand and strategically invest in technological innovation can achieve higher returns. The study introduces a new measure, Active Technological Similarity (ATS), which essentially quantifies how much a fund's investments are focused on similar types of technological innovations.

The key takeaway is that funds that increase their ATS, meaning they are investing more in similar types of technology, tend to outperform those that don't. This suggests that having a deep understanding of technological trends and being able to identify undervalued tech-focused firms can give fund managers a competitive edge.

For you as a CEO, this research highlights the importance of technological innovation as a factor in investment decisions. If your company is in the tech sector or heavily reliant on technological innovation, this could potentially make your company more attractive to certain mutual funds. Conversely, if you're considering investment options, funds with a high ATS could be a promising choice, given their potential for higher returns.
