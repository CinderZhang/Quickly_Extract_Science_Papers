A: Title: Does Borrowing from Banks Cost More than Borrowing from the Market?
Author: Michael Schwert



Q: Can you give me a very clear explanation of the core assertions, implications, and mechanics elucidated in this paper?

A: This paper by Michael Schwert investigates the pricing of bank loans in comparison to capital market debt. The author uses a unique sample of loans matched with bond spreads from the same firm on the same date to conduct the analysis. 

The core assertions of the paper are:

1. Banks earn a substantial interest rate premium relative to the price of credit risk implied by the bond market after accounting for seniority. This means that banks charge higher interest rates than what would be expected based on the credit risk of the borrower.

2. The author finds that the average bond-implied loan spread is between 140 and 170 basis points lower than the average all-in-drawn spread of 279 basis points in the subsample of secured term loans. This suggests that about half of the average loan spread is a premium in excess of the cost of credit implied by the bond market.

3. The paper also finds that the loan premium is unrelated to loan size, which contradicts the idea of perfect competition where banks would pass through the fixed component of their costs.

The implications of these findings are significant. They suggest that firms are willing to pay a premium for bank credit, raising questions about the nature of competition in the loan market. The paper also implies that borrowing from banks often aligns with the manager’s objective of minimizing interest expenses to maximize cash flows, even though banks earn a premium above the market price of credit risk.

The mechanics of the paper involve the use of both reduced-form and structural models of credit risk to account for the firm’s priority structure of debt. The author also uses a structural model of credit risk to quantify the magnitude of the loan premium. The model extends Merton (1974) to value senior and junior debt claims as options on the firm’s assets.



Q: Can you explain the value of this in basic terms? Like you're talking to a CEO. So what? What's the bottom line here?

A: Absolutely. The bottom line of this research is that when a company borrows from a bank, it often pays a higher interest rate than what the company's credit risk would imply. This means that banks are charging a premium on their loans, above and beyond what is expected based on the risk of the borrower. 

This premium doesn't seem to be related to the size of the loan, suggesting that it's not just about covering the bank's fixed costs. It appears that companies are willing to pay this premium for the benefits that come with bank loans, such as the ability to raise a large amount of debt quickly, flexibility in repayment terms, and the positive signal that comes from a bank's willingness to lend after screening the borrower.

So, as a CEO, when you're considering where to source debt, you need to weigh these benefits against the potential cost of this bank loan premium. While bank loans might come with a higher interest rate, they also offer flexibility and speed that may not be available in the capital market.
