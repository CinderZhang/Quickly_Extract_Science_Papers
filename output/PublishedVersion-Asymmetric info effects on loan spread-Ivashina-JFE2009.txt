A: Title: Asymmetric information effects on loan spreads
Author: Victoria Ivashina, Harvard Business School



Q: Can you give me a very clear explanation of the core assertions, implications, and mechanics elucidated in this paper?

A: This paper by Victoria Ivashina investigates the impact of information asymmetry between the lead bank and members of a lending syndicate on loan spreads. In a lending syndicate, the lead bank retains only a fraction of the loan but acts as the intermediary between the borrower and the syndicate participants. The lead bank has more information about the borrower's creditworthiness than the syndicate participants, creating an information asymmetry.

The core assertions of the paper are:

1. Information asymmetry between the lead bank and syndicate participants increases the interest rate on the loan. This is because the participants, lacking full information, perceive a higher risk and demand a higher return for their investment.

2. The lead bank's ownership share of the loan can mitigate the effects of information asymmetry. A larger share signals to participants that the lead bank has confidence in the loan's quality, reducing the perceived risk and the interest rate.

3. However, a larger ownership share also increases the lead bank's exposure to the loan's credit risk. This leads the bank to demand a higher interest rate, offsetting the reduction from decreased information asymmetry.

The paper uses shifts in the idiosyncratic credit risk of the lead bank's loan portfolio as an instrument to isolate the effect of information asymmetry on the loan spread. The results suggest that information asymmetry accounts for approximately 4% of the total cost of credit.

The implications of these findings are significant for both banks and borrowers. For banks, they highlight the trade-off between reducing information asymmetry and managing credit risk. For borrowers, they suggest that the structure of the lending syndicate can significantly impact the cost of borrowing.



Q: Can you explain the value of this in basic terms? Like you're talking to a CEO. So what? What's the bottom line here?

A: Certainly. This research essentially shows that when a bank is arranging a loan with multiple lenders (a syndicate), the less information those lenders have about the borrower, the higher the interest rate will be. This is because those lenders see the loan as riskier due to the lack of information. 

However, if the arranging bank keeps a larger portion of the loan itself, it signals to the other lenders that it has confidence in the loan, which can help to lower the interest rate. But, there's a catch. The more of the loan the arranging bank keeps, the more risk it takes on, which can push the interest rate back up.

The bottom line is that the way a loan is structured and how information is shared among lenders can significantly impact the cost of the loan. This is important for CEOs to understand as it can influence the cost of borrowing and the overall financial strategy of the company.
