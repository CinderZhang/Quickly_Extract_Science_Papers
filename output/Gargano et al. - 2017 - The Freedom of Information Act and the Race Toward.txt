Q: Save the title and authors of this paper.

A: Title: The Freedom of Information Act and the Race Toward Information Acquisition 

Authors: Antonio Gargano, Alberto G. Rossi and Russ Wermers



Q: Can you give me a very clear explanation of the core assertions, implications, and mechanics elucidated in this paper?

A: This paper investigates the use of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by institutional investors, particularly hedge funds, to gain access to non-public information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The authors argue that this information can provide these investors with a competitive advantage, allowing them to generate abnormal returns on their investments.

The core assertions of the paper are:

1. Institutional investors, especially hedge funds, actively use FOIA to obtain potentially valuable information from the FDA. This information is not fully private, as it can be accessed by anyone who requests it, but it is not publicly disseminated either.

2. The information obtained through FOIA requests is often highly technical and requires specific scientific competence to interpret. This means that the cost of obtaining and understanding this information can be high, which may deter less sophisticated investors.

3. Institutional investors who make FOIA requests often trade based on this activity. The authors found that when institutional holdings increase in conjunction with a FOIA request, the following quarter DGTW abnormal returns on the associated stocks average 6.58%. On the other hand, when institutional holdings decrease, the following quarter DGTW abnormal returns average -3.52%.

The implications of these findings are significant. They suggest that certain institutional investors are able to gain a competitive advantage by accessing and interpreting information that is not readily available to other market participants. This raises questions about the fairness and efficiency of the market.

The mechanics of how this works are also explained in the paper. Institutional investors submit FOIA requests to the FDA, often related to specific pharmaceutical firms. They then use the information they receive to inform their investment decisions. The authors use a combination of nonparametric tests and parametric panel regressions to analyze the trades of these investors and the returns they generate.



Q: Can you explain the value of this in basic terms? Like you're talking to a CEO. So what? What's the bottom line here?

A: The bottom line of this research is that certain institutional investors, particularly hedge funds, are using the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to non-public information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They are then using this information to make investment decisions that are generating significant returns.

This is important for a CEO to understand for a few reasons:

1. It highlights a strategy being used by sophisticated investors to gain a competitive edge in the market. If your company is in the pharmaceutical sector or any other industry regulated by a government agency, it's possible that investors are using FOIA requests to gain insights into your business.

2. It raises potential concerns about market fairness. If certain investors are able to access and interpret information that isn't readily available to others, it could create an uneven playing field.

3. It underscores the importance of transparency. If investors are going to these lengths to obtain information, it suggests a strong demand for transparency and disclosure from companies. As a CEO, it's worth considering how your company can meet this demand in a way that benefits all stakeholders.
